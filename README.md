🎓 Student Marks Predictor

The Student Marks Predictor is an end-to-end machine learning project that predicts a student’s overall exam performance using academic scores and socio-educational factors. This project demonstrates a complete ML workflow, from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis to model training and deployment with Streamlit.

📌 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to analyze student performance data and build a predictive model that estimates a student’s final exam score. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the project helps identify how factors such as gender, parental education level, lunch type, and test preparation course influence academic outcomes.
